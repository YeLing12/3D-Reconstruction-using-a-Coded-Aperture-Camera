3D Reconstruction using a Coded Aperture Camera

Information:

Calc_Kernel: This file is used to calculate blur kernel pattern via focus image and defocus image;
			 This code is based on the code of Michael Wang of CORNELL UNIVERSITY

Fast-Approximate-Energy-Minimization-via-Graph-Cuts-master: This code is based on code from 
			https://github.com/roflmaostc/Fast-Approximate-Energy-Minimization-via-Graph-Cuts
			and
			https://github.com/k920049/Fast-Approximate-Energy-Minimization-via-Graph-Cuts
			
colour_depth_code: this code is from Bando et al. 
			http://web.media.mit.edu/~bandy/rgb/
			
Levin_depth_code: this code is based on the code from Levin et al.
			https://groups.csail.mit.edu/graphics/CodedAperture/
			

Images: Some images are captured from the modified lens with new designed filter.
			The filter used to modify the lens is also included.

Note: These codes are written in three languages: C++, Python and Matlab.
